 In the osTicket ticket lifecycle consists of several stages, starting from the moment a support request is submitted to the final resolution and closure of the ticket. Here's an overview of the osTicket lifecycle:Ticket Creation (Intake): The lifecycle begins when a support request is received. This can happen in various ways:
Email Submission: A user sends an email to a designated support address, and osTicket automatically converts the email into a ticket. Web Portal Submission: A user submits a request via a form on the support portal, which is then turned into a ticket. Ticket Assignment: After a ticket is created, it is assigned to an appropriate support agent or team based on predefined rules or manual assignment. Ticket Handling: The assigned support agent investigates and works on resolving the issue. This stage may involve communication with the user, gathering additional information, and troubleshooting the problem. Resolution: Once the issue is resolved, the ticket is updated with a solution and marked as resolved. The user may be notified of the resolution and asked for feedback. Ticket Closure: After confirmation from the user or after a set period, the ticket is closed. This final stage ensures the issue has been satisfactorily resolved.

Here’s an overview of the osTicket lifecycle: The process begins when a support request is received. This can happen in a couple of ways. A user sends an email to a support address, and osTicket automatically converts the email into a ticket. A user submits a request through a form on the support portal, which is then turned into a ticket.

Once the agent determines that the issue has been resolved, they may reach out to the user for confirmation to ensure satisfaction. If the user confirms that the issue is resolved—or if no further response is required—the ticket is closed. The ticket is then marked as "Resolved" or "Closed," and the agent may include a final note summarizing the solution provided.

In the Active Directory, I can manage users and computers within a network environment. I can create, modify, and delete user accounts, assign roles, and set permissions to control access to resources. I can also manage computer objects, ensuring they are properly joined to the domain and configured with the necessary group policies. Additionally, I can organize users and computers into organizational units (OUs) for better structure and delegation of administrative tasks.
