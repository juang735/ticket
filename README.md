Once the ticket is created, it needs to be categorized and prioritized. This may involve:  Categories (such as Technical Support, Billing, etc.) are assigned to help the agents quickly understand the type of issue.  The ticket may be assigned to a specific department, team, or agent.

Once the agent believes the issue is resolved, they may seek confirmation from the user to ensure satisfaction, After the user confirms the issue has been resolved (or if no further response is needed), the ticket is closed. The ticket is marked as "Resolved" or "Closed," and the agent might add a final note summarizing the solution.
